# Imcome_spent_analysis-HierarchicalClustering 
______________________________________________

In this project, we use Hierarchical clustering to predict the Income spent. We categorize the information based on amount spend.

Procedure:                                                                                           
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found.                                                                                           
=> Collect dataset of Engine energy parameters.                                                                                           
=> Load dataset and summarize detials such as number of rows and columns.                                                                                        
=> Label encoding is done to convert male - 0 and female - 1.                                                                                           
=> We use Hierarchical clustering algorithm.                                                                                           
=> Data visualization in Dentrogram.                                                                                           
=> Fit the model in Agglomerative Algorithm. (2types - Alggomerative, divisive).                                                                                 
=> Visualise the cluster result.
